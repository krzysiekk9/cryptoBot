## What is it

This is a sample website, for a company that makes and sells trading bots.

---

## Technologies used

I made this website using:

- React,
- Styled Components,
- Spline,
- Gsap.

### How it's working

The main focus has been on the 3D aspect of this site. The 3D model of the robot from Spline is animated using gsap and makes the user experience more interesting. 
Other elements of this page are also animated using gsap. To make the animations work, I had to use the Context API and use Ref's for the React elements.
